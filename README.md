# HomeworkBot
NO MORE SHALL THY COPY

Pls read its worth it, work a little now, and save more time than you can imagine.

We students have all spent a massive chunck of our student lives copying others notes for teachers to check, only for it to be a waste of time and paper.

How is it that even in the 21st centuary we do this pointless activity? Huh? Well let's not get into the tanget on how the current generation of educations is flawed beyond words and such, and I hearby present the automation of such works.

Presenting : HomeworkBot ( Not a Bot right now, meh it'll happen )

Its a software like Photoshop or paint( not as cluttered like either of them, not as big as them either ), which lets you write IN YOUR HANDWRITING anywhere on any page as background, which is indisguishable to something that is written by hand. Yes, the time is now to be excited. 

Tho this is very early stage of the project, this is 12 November 2020 when i write and upload the stripped down version with azure linked in as it was issues. It will have many more ai features which right now is just a simple software.

As of now, we need to make our own handwriting as fonts. We can do this many ways the best of which is offered by https://www.calligraphr.com/ (THE BEST SITE TO MAKE FONTS).
Follow the steps :
  > Go to https://www.calligraphr.com/ make free account whatever and stuff.
  
  > Now download the template with symbols you commonly use in notebooks : A-Z , a-z , 1-9 , -+/= and stuff, keep in mind only 75 symbols can be made to font with free account, so pick only the ones which is most important, and we can do stuff like replace 0 with O cause it's kinda the same.
  
  > NOW THE MAGIC, just drop the font inside the HwBot/Fonts/ , make more and more and more fonts! The code picks randomly out of the big subset, bigger the subset, more natural looking, just don't make them too different, that makes it look funky, which looks fake.
  
  > Type in! Just drag and drop a image which you want to use as the background. Type whatever you want whereever, change colors and stuff with the tools. A lotta work is needed to be done, but it gets the job done for now. I WILL WORK ON IT PLZ UNDERSTAND ITS NOT EASY IM JUST WANT TIME.
  
  
#Tips : 
  > Making font isn't a mindless activiy, you need to write them with uniformity, set the spacing to something which looks natural, and also adjust thier baseline. Only then will the font look, you know, beautiful, and real too.
  
  > I INCOURAGE YOU TO MODIFY STUFF LIKE FONT SIZE, FONT ANGLE, ETC TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE GOOD, AND SOME UI FEATURES AND PLEASE SHARE,, EVERY ONE SHOULD ENJOY THE GOOD STUFF
  
  > Yeah don't mess with any other parts of the code, even if you are good with java and processing. Some concepts are more advanced and very very very very very very sophisticated, turst me it's all just magic.
  
  > READ HOTKEYS.
  
#HOTKEYS : 
  > LEFTCLICK to put the cursor there, start typing!
  
  > RIGHTCLICK TO PAN, very very useful.
  
  > MIDDLECLICK TO PEEK, very useful too.
  
  > SCROLL IN AND OUT FOR ZOOMING THE ENIRE PROGRAM.
  
  > TAB will hide the UI ( cursor is UI too ), make sure you do this before saving.
  
  > 'F1' goes and pastes what is in your clipboard, like cntrl+v.
  
  > '`' resets the pan and zoom, use this a lot, saves to you a lotta issues.
  
  > '~' SAVES THE FILE TO DESKTOP THIS IS YOU FINISHED WORK, MAKE SURE YOU COPY OR SAVE THESES FILES ELSEWHERE IF NEEDED. 
  
  > ALSO HIDE UI WHEN SAVING, And ZOOOM OUT UNTIL YOU SEE THE ENTIRE PAGE, IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE PAGE, PROGRAM CAN'T EITHER.
